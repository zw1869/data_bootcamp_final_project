# Data Bootcamp Final Project

This project was completed by Harry Wu, with Spencer Libbing and Jessica Guo, in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2020. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others-including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and the course.

# Project Description

Airbnb is an online vacation rental marketplace that that took its company public on December 10th, 2020 in one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of 2020. Through the service, users can arrange lodging and tourism experiences or list their properties for rental. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties but instead profits by receiving commission from each booking.

Our project seeks to use listing data for Airbnb properties in NYC in 2019, as found on 'NY_Listings.csv' from https://www.kaggle.com/samyukthamurali/airbnb-ratings-dataset. We aim to determine what characteristics make for the best Airbnb listing to help future hosts optimize where and how they list they properties.

Ideas:<br>
What can we learn about different hosts and areas?<br>
What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)<br>
Which hosts are the busiest and why?<br>
Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
